Here you go, two CSV files taken from the oscilloscope!

TEK0000.CSV has the time versus stopping voltage data.  TEK0001.CSV has the current versus time data.

We do not really care about the time of course, but it is in the files.  Time is the first column of
data and the voltage/current is the second column.   These files are for a 405nm source, I have data for
other wavelengths if you want.

The theoretical function is in the attached pdf [ModernLab.pdf in this directory].
